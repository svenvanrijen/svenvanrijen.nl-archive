Hi there!

My name is Sven van Rijen, born and raised in Breda, The Netherlands. Currently, I live in the pretty town Wageningen, also in The Netherlands. 

I'm working in IT since 1999 and started as a Windows NT 4.0 admin. Yeah, I'm that old :wink:.
Over time, I worked for various companies and had a wide range of roles and responisibilties. For a full breakdown of my career, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/svenvanrijen).

In my current role as a Senior Engineer, Iâ€™m responsible for the development of the new modern IT Workspace of [Wageningen University & Research](http://www.wur.nl/en.htm). 
At the moment my personal focus is mainly on PowerShell (DSC), Azure and automation in a broad perspective.
