Hi all! After a bit of a time-out (I left my old job and started at my new one in the mean time), I finally found some time to start blogging again!
This Friday, October 6th 2017, I will visit the [AppManageEvent](http://www.appmanagevent.com) in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

# Visiting AppManagEvent 2017

It will be the first time that I'll visit this event, but I've heard some great stories about the previous editions. This year the speaker line up looks pretty good too, so I'm really looking forward to it.
